    In 1989 Sol (Mother) and Juana
    (Daughter) started baking from home,
    selling their products to neighbors and
    friends. A year later they opened their
    first small bakery, Torta y Merengue,
    and started to sell their products to the
    public with great success. A few years
    after they opened their second bakery.
    This was truly a family business and
    they were lucky to have the help of
    Adelita (Nanny) and Germán (Son) to
    make their dream come true.

    Sol and Juana believe in high
    quality, homemade, delicious
    baking products; they bake with their
    hearts making sure that their clients
    can taste their love in every single product.
    Sol moved to the United States in 2000,
    Juana followed her two years later.
    Now, after many, many moons, they
    decided to start doing what they
    like to do most, baking with love!
    …. and Sol's Cookies & Cakes  was born.
