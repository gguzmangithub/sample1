 In 1989 Sol (Mother) and Juana  
(Daughter) started baking from home, 
 selling their products to neighbors and 
 friends. A year later they opened their 
 first small bakery, Torta y Merengue, 
 and started to sell their products to the 
 public with great success. Few years 
 after they opened their second bakery. 
 This was a truly family business and 
 they were lucky to have the help of 
 Adelita (Nanny) and Germán (Son) to 
 make their dream come true.

 Sol and Juana always believed in high  
 quality, home made style, delicious 
 baking products; they baked with their 
 hearts making sure that their clients 
 could taste their love in every single product.  
 In 2000 Sol moved to the United States, 
 Juana followed her after two years. 
 Now, after many, many moons, they 
 decided to start doing again what they 
 like to do the most, baking with love! 
 …. and Sol's Cookies & Cakes  was born.
